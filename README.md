# MV3 Chrome Extension CRA Template #
This [Create React App (CRA)](https://create-react-app.dev/) template provides rapid development for chrome extensions using [Manifest V3](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/intro/). It optionally implements [MUI](https://mui.com/) as its UI framework (for interfaces such as popups, options, etc.) in addition to some minimal boilerplate for getting an extension up and running.

## Usage ##
Provide this package as a template when creating a new React app, e.g.:

```npx create-react-app APP_NAME --template mv3-chrome-extension```

Afterwards, you can develop your React app as normal (see the template README for more information on developing with this template). Learn more about [using custom templates with CRA](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/#selecting-a-template).

## Contributing ##
Contributing is welcome, just be sure to fork [the package repository](https://github.com/lewxdev/cra-template-mv3-chrome-extension) and submit a pull request on your changes.
